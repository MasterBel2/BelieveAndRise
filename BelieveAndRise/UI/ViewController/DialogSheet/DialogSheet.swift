 An input dialogue sheet template intended to be subclassed.

 This class is intended only to be used as a sheet, calling `dismiss(_:)` to dismiss itself when its task is complete.

 Subclasses should provide input controls and an operation to be executed when the user is finished editing. Input controls should be added to the `controlsToDisable` array

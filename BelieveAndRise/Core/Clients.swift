 Sent to a client who just joined the channel. This command informs the client of the list of
 users present in the channel, including the client itself.

 This command is always sent (to a client joining a channel), and the list it conveys includes
 the newly joined client. It is sent after all the CLIENTSFROM commands. Once CLIENTS has been
 processed, the joining client has been informed of the full list of other clients and bridged
 clients currently present in the joined channel.
